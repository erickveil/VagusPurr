# Vagus Purr

A simple app that makes your phone vibrate continuously.

Great for meditation.

- Run app
- Press the side of your phone against your chest or your head.
- Meditate

Non-electrical stimulation for your vagus nerve.
Open source. No ads. Just works.

It's sort-of like having a purring cat sitting on your chest.

On my phone, I find it works best if I press the side edge of my phone against my sternum while running the app. The flat back or front doesn't seem to pass the vibrations as mutch.

YMMV.
